## Install and Configure zsh

**What is it? What will I be using it for?**

Right now our terminal is not very user friendly. We're going to change our shell from `bash` to `zsh` and install a plugin called `oh my zsh` to give us some very useful shortcuts and coloring.

**How do I install it?**

In the terminal run:

`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

You may have to type in your password if it asks you, and when you are done with this, in the terminal, type `zsh`.
