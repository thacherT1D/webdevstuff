# Programming Fundamentals Review

## Standards

- Create and access complex nested data structures
- Control the flow of a program using conditionals and loops
- Encapsulate reusable code in functions

## Objectives

By the end of these exercises you should be able to execute the standards above with **fluency**.

## Rationale

When you dig into more complicated algorithms and data structures you want to be able to let your brain focus on the task at hand, not basic arrays / objects / loops / indices etc...

So while we've covered these standards before, the objective for this is **automaticity**.

## Get warmed up

Complete these two:

- https://github.com/gSchool/round-robin-js

## Work with objects and arrays

Complete this exercise:

🕗You should be able to solve all challenges in under 2 hours.

    <li>➡️ https://github.com/gSchool/amusement-parks-objects-arrays-js</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Your goal here is fluency - these exercises should seem _easy_ and _quick_.</p>

  <p>Burn them down and do it again until you feel fluent.</p>

## Do some more complicated loops

Complete this exercise:
